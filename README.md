# Portfolio Website

My personal web-spot, and I don't even have to pay for hosting.

I don't feel there's much to describe here. You probably shouldn't even be looking at this.

Yeah.

Go away.

It's a pretty basic page right now, anyway. It uses Bootstrap (sans the security update), a theme called Lux, and nearly nothing else.
